# GeoUtils.jl

A collection of functions that are hopefully useful to facilitate workflows for Earth Scientists.

> [!WARNING]
> ðŸš§ This package is under constant development. ðŸš§

## ðŸ“¦ Installation
To install GeoUtils, add the package from the Manager
```
using Pkg
Pkg.add("GeoUtils")
```

To use it in your scripts or in the REPL type
```
using GeoUtils
```

For help you can query the functions by typing in the REPL
```
julia> ?kde_map_Makie!
```

## ðŸ“Š Visualisation routines
### Plot updates in CairoMakie
When monitoring convergence in geodynamic solvers or running simulations it is often very useful to visualize the evolution of diagnostic quantities in (pseudo-) time. The functions `update_plot_Makie!(...)` facilitate the update of plots within loops.

### Kernel density maps
The `kde_map_Makie!(...)` functions plot kernel-density distributions of bivariate data.
